# Scalable Academic Paper Search via Distributed Processing and Parallel Computing

**Status: In Development**

A high-performance semantic search engine for academic literature that leverages distributed computing and advanced NLP techniques to deliver intelligent paper discovery at scale.

## Overview

This project is developing a scalable academic paper search system designed to handle massive datasets of scholarly publications. By combining semantic understanding with distributed processing capabilities, our goal is to provide researchers with precise, meaning-based search results rather than simple keyword matching.

The planned system will process millions of academic papers from various sources and create a searchable knowledge base that understands the semantic relationships between different research topics, methodologies, and findings.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **S2ORC (Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus)** dataset, a comprehensive collection of academic papers spanning multiple disciplines. S2ORC provides structured metadata and full-text content for millions of scholarly publications.

- **Scale**: Millions of academic papers across various domains
- **Format**: Structured JSON with metadata and full-text content
- **Coverage**: Computer Science, Medicine, Biology, Physics, and more

## Planned System Architecture

### Data Collection Pipeline (In Progress)
- **Multi-source ingestion**: Academic databases (IEEE, JSTOR) via APIs and torrent downloads
- **Format standardization**: Conversion of various document formats to unified structure
- **Quality filtering**: Removal of incomplete or corrupted documents

### Text Processing Engine (Development Phase)
- **HTML tag removal**: Clean extraction of textual content
- **Symbol normalization**: Standardization of mathematical notation and special characters
- **Stopword elimination**: Removal of common words that don't contribute to semantic meaning
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into meaningful units
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduction of words to their root forms

### Semantic Understanding Layer (Research Phase)
- **NLP Processing**: Advanced natural language processing to extract semantic meaning
- **Embedding Generation**: Conversion of textual content into high-dimensional vector representations
- **Topic Modeling**: Identification of key themes and research areas
- **Relationship Extraction**: Discovery of connections between concepts and papers

### Vector Database Storage (Evaluation Phase)
Evaluating multiple vector database backends:
- **FAISS**: Facebook AI Similarity Search for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval

- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database service for production deployments

### Distributed Computing Framework (Design Phase)
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded operations for data ingestion and indexing
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of search queries across multiple processing nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities to handle growing datasets

## Planned Features

### Semantic Search Capabilities (In Development)
- **Intent Understanding**: Interpret research queries beyond simple keyword matching

### Advanced Ranking System (Design Phase)
- **Semantic Similarity**: Primary ranking based on vector similarity scores
- **Citation Impact**: Integration of citation counts and paper influence metrics
- **Recency Weighting**: Adjustable preference for recent publications
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized ranking for different academic disciplines

### Performance Optimizations (Future Work)
- **Caching Layer**: Intelligent caching of frequent queries and results
- **Index Optimization**: Efficient data structures for fast retrieval
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized handling of multiple concurrent searches
- **Memory Management**: Efficient resource utilization for large-scale operations
